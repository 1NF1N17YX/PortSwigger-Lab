Lab #2 - File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass

Target Goal - Retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

Analysis:

This is the potential directory path where the app may store the image files:
/var/www/images/65.jpg

experimenting the payloads on the vulerable filename parameter :

../../../etc/passwd

then

/etc/passwd
